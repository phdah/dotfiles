# Linux Setup
My personal dotfiles for any Linux distro that I run.

Currently for
* Arch
* Ubuntu

### Install
Run the install script for the choice of distro
```bash
./arch_install.sh
```
or
```bash
./ubuntu_install.sh
```
or
```bash
./wsl_install.sh
```
These will `isntall`, `git clone` and `symlink` all apps and their configured dotfiles.

### WSL specific
Set `Ubuntu` as the default `terminal`and for colors, make a new color scheme and setup
```bash
Foreground              #D8DEE9
Background              #2E3440
Cursor color            #81A1C1
Selection background    #FFFACD
```
